# Introduction
You must analyze your students and ask how they want the final grade to be distributed to create this algorithm. I would organize the answers and try to find a pattern of similar answers after you gather the data. You can begin creating an algorithm once it's complete.
 


# Requirements

Any Python compiler

# Pseudo Code
My style is to take into account my findings and to create a grade calculator for a final grade. For instance: My fellow student classmates decided to split up to 50 percent of their final grade percentage. 20% for quizzes/tests and 30% for discussion The basic calculator returned a final grade of letters A â€“ C


# Configuration
I'd have a sample of classmates in order to set it up.
Try creating a mini gradebook. I'd like to add a comment to include the name of the students. I would create a single variable for each person. For instance, the variable "iames" would be the name of a person James T. I would also create variables for laboratories, tests and discussion. I would also create variables. I'd add a list with the scores received by students in the different percentage sections. The fact that Python is an average function is a cool thing. In order to get the total average, I would call the values in different arrays. I would use a basic to return a letter grade if statements and other statements
